Scripts from a Russian course 'Введение в машинное обучение' (Introduction to
Machine Learning) made by NRU HSE & Yandex, which I took on Coursera in
01/2020-02/2020.

This is basic Machine Learning with scikit-learn, but that is only the
beginning of my study. Traditionally, the last week is made all by myself,
however, there are some obscure points due to the course's task.
